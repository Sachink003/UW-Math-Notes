\section{Mathematical prerequisites}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Mathematical Analysis/Calculus - limits, derivatives and Riemann integrals (knowledge of real analysis, lebesgue integrals and measure theory will be helpful)
    \item Linear Algebra - vector spaces, matrices, eigenvalues and eigenvectors.
    \item Probability Theory - discrete and continuous probability distributions, statistical inference, and random variables (stochastic calculus \& processes and measure-theoretic probability will be helpful).
    \item Statistics - mean, variance, estimation, hypothesis testing, forecasting \& regression and implementation in R, MATLAB or excel/VBA is preferred.
    \item Differential Equations - ordinary and partial differential equations (knowledge of stochastic differential equations will be helpful).
    \item Computer Programming - Knowledge about Data Structures and Algorithms \& and its implementation in Python or C++ is required.
    \item Numerical methods - numerical techniques for solving mathematical problems using mainly finite differences and Monte Carlo simulations.
\end{enumerate}
